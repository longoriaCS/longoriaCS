#Ms. Longoria (she/her)

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, yeehaw. 🤠 🐮 🐐
CS is the best class, but my favorite CS class in university was a cryptography course I took.
I am a high school teacher at Heights High School, I teach AP Computer Science Principles!
I'm an avid (and used to be pro) Tetris player, but I also play a lot of other games such as Dead by Daylight, Smash Ultimate, Beat Saber, Skyrim, and more!
I skateboard sometimes, and I like to go to the park with my fiancee to take my Husky out.
I'm not knowledgeable in movies and shows, ask me about any movie or shoe and I could in fact tell you I have **not** seen it.
My favorite animals are goats and cows!!
I'm addicted to candy 🤤 and I listen to an unhealthy amount of Dance Gavin Dance.

Fun fact: I've listened to one Dance Gavin Dance song on repeat for 7 months in a row.

Hydrate or diedrate!
